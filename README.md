#  Fake News Detector

> RISE Internship Project 4 â€“ Tamizhan Skills  
> Built with Scikit-Learn, TF-IDF, PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and Streamlit

A machine learning-based web app that classifies news articles as either **Real** or **Fake** based on their textual content. This is the fourth project from the **Machine Learning & AI** track of the RISE Internship by Tamizhan Skills.

---

##  Project Objective

To build a fake news detection model that:
  - Loads and combines real and fake news data from CSV files
  - Cleans and preprocesses the text using regex and vectorization
  - Trains a **PassiveAggressiveClassifier** using TF-IDF features
  - Provides an interactive Streamlit interface for real-time prediction

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn (TF-IDF + PassiveAggressiveClassifier)**
- **Joblib** (for model persistence)
- **Streamlit** (for frontend UI)

---

##  Project Structure

```bash
fake-news-detector/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                     # Streamlit frontend for fake news prediction
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                    # Model training and evaluation script
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt           # All required packages
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fake.csv               # Fake news articles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ true.csv               # Real news articles
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ news_model.pkl         # Trained PassiveAggressiveClassifier model
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tfidf_vectorizer.pkl   # TF-IDF vectorizer
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ preprocess.py          # Text cleaning and preprocessing logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # You're reading it ðŸ˜‰

## Dataset

- Source: Fake and Real News Dataset â€“ Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- fake.csv: News articles labeled as Fake
- true.csv: News articles labeled as Real
- Merged and labeled for binary classification (0 = Fake, 1 = Real)

---

## How to Run

- Step 1: Install Dependencies
  
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Step 2: Train the Model
  
```bash
  python main.py
```

- Step 3: Launch the Web App
  
```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```

## Model Performance

âœ… Accuracy: ~93% on validation split
âœ… Fast and efficient PassiveAggressiveClassifier
âœ… TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
âœ… Minimal false positives on curated news samples

---

## Highlights

- Cleans noisy text with custom regex logic
- Uses shuffled merged dataset from real & fake news
- Highly interpretable and efficient binary classifier
- Real-time predictions through a clean Streamlit UI
- Modular, scalable codebase for future NLP upgrades
